# Math Questions App

## Description

An interactive math app I developed using React and Go to help my niece practice solving story problems. This app offers a variety of math questions, ranging from simple addition and subtraction to multi-step problems, personalized with the student's name for a more engaging experience. It also includes accessibility features like dark mode, large text, and text-to-speech.

## Features

-   Personalized math questions for addition and subtraction.
-   Dynamic Text to Speech for reading questions aloud.
-   Accessibility options including dark mode and enlarged text.
-   Themes that change based on student preferences.
-   Images accompanying each question for a more interactive experience.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-questions-app.git` 

Navigate to the app's directory:

`cd math-questions-app` 

Install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install` 

Run the app:

`npm start` 

## Usage

Upon launching, the app displays math questions one at a time. Students can choose their preferred accessibility settings and proceed to answer the questions. Incorrect attempts are gently corrected, and hints are provided for difficult questions.
