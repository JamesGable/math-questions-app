# Math Questions App

## Description

An interactive math app I developed using React and Go to help my niece practice solving story problems. This app offers a variety of math questions, ranging from simple addition and subtraction to multi-step problems, personalized with the student's name for a more engaging experience. It also includes accessibility features like dark mode, large text, and text-to-speech.

## Features

-   Personalized math questions for addition and subtraction.
-   Dynamic Text to Speech for reading questions aloud.
-   Accessibility options including dark mode and enlarged text.
-   Themes that change based on student preferences.
-   Images accompanying each question for a more interactive experience.


## Installation

### Frontend

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-questions-app.git` 

Navigate to the app's directory:

`cd math-questions-app` 

Install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install` 

Run the app:

`npm start` 

### Backend

Navigate to the backend directory within the cloned repository:

`cd path/to/backend` 

Run the Go server:

`go run main.go` 

Ensure Go is installed on your machine. The backend server will start, typically listening on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the frontend and backend are running, students can interact with the app, choose accessibility settings, and respond to math questions. The Go backend will handle data related to students' PNP settings.
